# A Django Wedding Website and Invitation + Guest Management System

## What's included?
This includes everything we did for our own product launching feedback:

-A responsive, single-page traditional website
-A complete feedback control application

## Installation

This is developed for Python 3 and Django 2.2.

It's recommended that you setup a virtualenv before development.

Then just install requirements, migrate, and runserver to get started:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```
